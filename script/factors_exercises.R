# Factors
## Introduction
### Prerequisites
library(tidyverse)

## Creating factors
x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")

x2 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")

sort(x1)

month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)

y1 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
y1
sort(y1)

y2 <- factor(x2, levels = month_levels)
y2

y2 <- parse_factor(x2, levels = month_levels)

factor(x1)

f1 <- factor(x1, levels = unique(x1))
f1
f2 <- x1 %>% factor() %>% fct_inorder()
f2

levels(f2)

## General Social Survey
gss_cat

gss_cat %>%
  count(race)

ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)

### Exercise
#### Explore the distribution of rincome (reported income). What makes the default bar chart hard to understand? How could you improve the plot?
  
#### What is the most common relig in this survey? What’s the most common partyid?
gss_cat %>%
  count(relig) %>% 
  arrange(n)
  
gss_cat %>%
  count(partyid) %>% 
  arrange(n)

#### Which relig does denom (denomination) apply to? How can you find out with a table? How can you find out with a visualisation?
gss_cat %>%
  count(denom) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  print(n=30)

## Modifying factor order
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%
  summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, relig)) + geom_point()

ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))) +
  geom_point()

relig_summary %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_reorder(relig, tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tvhours, relig)) +
  geom_point()

rincome_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(rincome) %>%
  summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, rincome)) + geom_point()

ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, fct_reorder(rincome, age))) + geom_point()

ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, fct_relevel(rincome, "Not applicable"))) +
  geom_point()

by_age <- gss_cat %>%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %>%
  count(age, marital) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

ggplot(by_age, aes(age, prop, colour = marital)) +
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(by_age, aes(age, prop, colour = fct_reorder2(marital, age, prop))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(colour = "marital")

gss_cat %>%
  mutate(marital = marital %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(marital)) +
  geom_bar()

### Exercises

#### There are some suspiciously high numbers in tvhours. Is the mean a good summary?

#### For each factor in gss_cat identify whether the order of the levels is arbitrary or principled.

#### Why did moving “Not applicable” to the front of the levels move it to the bottom of the plot?

## Modifying factor levels
gss_cat %>% count(partyid)

gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
                              "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
                              "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
                              "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
                              "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
                              "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
                              "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid) 

gss_cat %>%
mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
                            "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
                            "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
                            "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
                            "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
                            "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
                            "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
                            "Other"                 = "No answer",
                            "Other"                 = "Don't know",
                            "Other"                 = "Other party"
)) %>%
count(partyid)

gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,
                                other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
                                rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
                                ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
                                dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)

gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig)) %>%
  count(relig)

gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig, n = 10)) %>%
  count(relig, sort = TRUE) %>%
  print(n = Inf)

### Exercises
#### How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent changed over time?
  
#### How could you collapse rincome into a small set of categories?
